# Teams SDK: Pros & Cons

| Pros                                                                                                     | Cons                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| We own our own SDK so we can make whatever changes we want to suit our needs                             | We own our own SDK so we have to maintain it |
| We can tailor the experience to be more Teams specific, leading to better Partner experience             | Inter-Company politics?                      |
| We can simplify the codebase considerably                                                                |                                              |
| We can offer a new app building experience that is backwards compatible by offering a botbuilder adapter |                                              |
| It will likely be less work in the short and long term to have our own SDK                               |                                              |
| We would still be cross-org compatible since the new SDK would still use the activity protocol           |                                              |

## TLDR

Why would we not want to own the SDK that effects our entire workflow and success?
