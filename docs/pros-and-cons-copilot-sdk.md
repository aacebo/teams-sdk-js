# Copilot SDK: Pros & Cons

| Pros                                           | Cons                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Teams would not need to own the bot SDK pieces | We might still need to own for JS/TS/Python if Copilot SDK team isn't willing to port and maintain.                                                                           |
| One Microsoft                                  | We would not have ownership of the bot SDK pieces, meaning limited power of change when new activities or fast changes need to be made                                        |
|                                                | Copilot SDK seems like mostly a rebranding of Botbuilder, so we can expect it to be similar which isn't good because internal and external developers do not like Botbuilder. |
|                                                | Our team does not currently have the developer capacity to contribute to such a large project.                                                                                |
|                                                | Azure deprioritized Botbuilder and essentially stopped maintaining it once, they can do it again. Why put ourselves in that situation when we could own our own?              |

## TLDR

Why should we contribute so much effort and get so little control?
