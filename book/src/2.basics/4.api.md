# Using the API Client

an instance of the web api client is passed to handlers that can be used
to fetch team/meeting/conversation/etc... details.

> Example: we use the api client to fetch the conversations array of members.

```typescript
app.on('message', async ({ activity, api }) => {
    const members = await api.conversations.members(activity.conversation.id).get();
});
```
