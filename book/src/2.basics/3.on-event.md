# ðŸ‘‚ Listening To Events

To listen/subscribe to different event types, you can use the `event()` method.
Handlers will be called in the order they are added.

> Example: When a user signs in using `OAuth` or `SSO`, use the graph api to
> fetch their profile and say hello.

```typescript
app.event('signin', async ({ activity, tokenResponse, send }) => {
    const msgraph = graph(tokenResponse.token);
    const me: MSGraph.User = await msgraph.api('/me').get();

    await send({
        type: 'message',
        text: `ðŸ‘‹ Hello ${me.name}`,
    });
});
```
