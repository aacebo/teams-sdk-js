# ðŸ‘‚ Listening To Activities

To listen/subscribe to different activity types, you can use the `on()` method.
Handlers will be called in the order they are added.

> Example: an echo bot that listens for messages sent to it and responds.

```typescript
app.on('message', async ({ activity, send }) => {
    await send({ type: 'message', text: `you said: "${activity.text}"` });
});
```
