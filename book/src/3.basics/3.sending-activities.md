# ðŸ’¬ Sending Activities

To send an activity you can either use the `send` or `reply` methods.

> Example: an echo bot that listens for messages sent to it and responds.

```typescript
app.on('message', async ({ activity, reply }) => {
    await reply({ type: 'message', text: `you said: "${activity.text}"` });
});
```
